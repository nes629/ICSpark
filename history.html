        <h2>Ancient Hawaii</h2>
        <img class="banner-img" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Jean-Pierre_Norblin_de_La_Gourdaine_%28after_Louis_Choris%29%2C_Temple_du_Roi_dans_la_baie_Tiritatéa_%28c._1816%2C_published_1822%29.jpg" alt="Ancient Hawaiian Temple">
        <div class="content">
            <p>The first settlers arrived in Hawaii around 1,500 years ago, believed to be Polynesians from the Marquesas Islands. They brought with them their culture, language, and knowledge of navigation, setting the foundations for Hawaii's unique way of life. The ancient Hawaiians developed a complex system of agriculture, religious practices, and social organization.</p>
            <p>Hawaiians were deeply connected to their land and the ocean, which formed the foundation of their cultural beliefs and practices. Some of the sacred places from this period, like the petroglyphs and heiau (temples), can still be visited today. The Polynesian voyaging canoes are also iconic symbols of Hawaiian ingenuity and connection to the sea.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>In 1778, Captain James Cook became the first European to visit the Hawaiian Islands, marking the beginning of increased contact with the outside world. This encounter led to the introduction of new diseases, which devastated the native population. The islands were exposed to Western goods, weapons, and ideas that would forever alter their way of life.</p>
            <p>The arrival of European settlers and missionaries began the process of transforming Hawaiian society. The Hawaiian monarchy attempted to navigate the challenges of colonization while trying to protect its sovereignty and traditions. Unfortunately, Western diseases and the loss of land to foreign interests would have a lasting impact on the indigenous people.</p>

        <h2>The Kingdom of Hawaii</h2>
        <img class="banner-img" src="https://www.nea.org/sites/default/files/legacy/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-07-at-8.31.51-AM-e1525707410865.png" alt="King Kamehameha I">
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the late 18th century, King Kamehameha I united the Hawaiian Islands, forming the Kingdom of Hawaii. This unification allowed the islands to develop a cohesive identity and to establish economic and cultural relationships with other nations. King Kamehameha's vision for the Kingdom was one of strength and stability, balancing both Hawaiian traditions and foreign influences.</p>
            <p>During the monarchy, Hawaii developed a unique political and economic system. The monarchy’s leadership, such as Queen Liliʻuokalani, worked to protect the rights of native Hawaiians and resist growing American influence. However, the eventual overthrow of the monarchy by American business interests marked the beginning of a new chapter in Hawaii's history.</p>

        <h2>Hawaii's Statehood</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>After the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893, Hawaii became a U.S. territory. This was a turbulent time for the native Hawaiian people, who lost much of their sovereignty and land. Despite this, Hawaii continued to grow as a strategic military and economic location during both World Wars.</p>
            <p>On August 21, 1959, Hawaii officially became the 50th state of the United States. The statehood movement was supported by many in Hawaii, but it also created tensions with those who felt that it compromised Hawaii’s cultural integrity. The admission of Hawaii as a state marked the beginning of new economic opportunities but also sparked debates about the preservation of Hawaiian culture.</p>
